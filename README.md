# Welcome

Welcome to my repository for agent based modeling. In this repository you will find agent based models for various economic concepts.

## Comparative Advantage
The concept of comparative advantage is used to show that entities with different *relative* capacities can benefit from specializing in the production of one good and exchanging for the other good (division of labor) rather than splitting their time to produce both goods themselves (autarky). The implications are used to explain international trade, as well as why do-it-yourself projects are not always a good idea. For my research interests I particularly like this model because it helps explain why household recycling rates are so low--even for products households are capable of recycling--as well as why the world spends resources shipping garbage around.

The simpliest presetation of this concept is with two goods and two entites, presented in the tables below. Entity 1 has a comparative advantage in producing Good 1, Entity 2 has a comparative advantage in producing Good 2, and through specialization total production can increase to 140 units from the 130 units expected in autkary.

The upshot:
1. Specialization results in a higher production of goods relative to autarky.
2. This fact remains even if one entity has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods (exception: if the entity's absolute advantage is a multiple of the other entity's production possibilities, no relative differences exist and no comparative advantage).

#### Principle of Comparative Advantage

|        | Entity 1 | Entity 2 |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| Good 1 | 60       | 100      |
| Good 2 | 20       | 80       |

#### Autarky:
|        | Entity 1 | Entity 2 | Total Production |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Good 1 | 30       | 50       | 80               |
| Good 2 | 10       | 40       | 50               |
| Total  | 40       | 90       | **130**          |

#### Specialization:
|        | Entity 1 | Entity 2 | Total Production |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Good 1 | **60**   | 0        | 60               |
| Good 2 | 0        | **80**   | 80               |
| Total  | 60       | 80       | **140**          |
