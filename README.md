# Welcome

Welcome to my repository for agent based modeling. In this repository you will find agent based models for various economic concepts.

## Comparative Advantage
The concept of comparative advantage is used to show that entities with different *relative* capacities can benefit from specializing in the production of one good and exchanging for the other good (division of labor) rather than splitting their time to produce both goods themselves (autarky). The implications are used to explain international trade, as well as why do-it-yourself projects are not always a good idea.

The goal of the ABM is to show how individuals with knowledge of their own self-interest a relatively limited view of the world around them coordinate to increase production through specialization and exchange.
