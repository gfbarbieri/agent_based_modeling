## Comparative Advantage
Comparative advantage is used to explain the extensive (and rewarding) divisions of labor observed in economies. The upshot is that entities with different relative capacities benefit from specializing in the production of a few goods and exchanging for other goods rather than splitting their time to produce both goods themselves. The goal of the ABM is to demonstrate that individuals guided by self-interest use prices to discover their comparative advantage and improve their situation through exchange.
